### Author: Xuan Huang 2022-12-03

# Introduction

Older people have higher rates of comorbidities and may experience more inflammatory responses. Therefore,the COVID-19 deaths proportion of total deaths for the elderly will be higher than the younger. Herein, we aimed to explore the association between age and the deaths involving COVID-19.

## Data Set Information

The data set in this study comes from the Nation Center for Health Statistics, which contains death data from all residents in the USA. The data set keep updated. I used the date set from 01/01/2020 to 11/19/2022. If you want to reproduce the study, you can assign the new period you want. The data set I used contains 5 different attributes, of which information is provided about each column below:

**COVID-19 Deaths: ** The number of people dying from COVID-19

**Total Deaths: ** The total number of deaths

**Age Group: ** Under 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, 85 years and over

**Sex: ** Female, Male

**State: ** all US states


# Questions to be Addressed:

For this study, we are interested in **What is the association between age groups and COVID-19 deaths proportion of total deaths?**

*Secondary Analyses: *

1. Is the association between age groups and COVID-19 deaths proportion of total deaths sex-specific?

2. Does the association between age groups and COVID-19 deaths proportion of total deaths vary from US states?
