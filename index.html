<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Older people have higher rates of comorbidities and may experience
more inflammatory responses. Therefore,the COVID-19 deaths proportion of
total deaths for the elderly will be higher than the younger. Herein, we
aimed to explore the association between age and the deaths involving
COVID-19.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>The raw dataset we used is from nation center for health statistics.
Beside age and proportion of deaths involving COVID-19, we also include
sex and state variables in our dataset. Because deaths involving
COVID-19 may be sex-specific, and the vaccination satus may vary from
different states.</p>
<p>Including sex and state variables can help us stratify the COVID-19
death proportion in different age groups.</p>
<p>COVID-19 deaths proportion: COVID-19 Deaths/Total Deaths</p>
<p>Age Group: Under 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-34
years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years,
85 years and over</p>
<p>Sex: Female, Male</p>
<p>State: US states</p>
</div>
<div id="main-question" class="section level1">
<h1>Main Question</h1>
<p><strong>What is the association between age groups and COVID-19
deaths proportion of total deaths?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Wrangling</h1>
<p>We used the data from 01/01/2020 to 11/19/2022. When we check the
value of Age groups variable, we find some of age groups are overlapped.
So we need to remove some of age group. Also, we calculate the COVID-19
deaths proportion of total deaths.</p>

<p>Basically, there is a trend of age groups and COVID-19 deaths
proportion. With the increase of age, the probability of dying from
COVID-19 get higher. But after 75 years old, this probability goes
down.</p>

<p>From this line chart, for both female and male, the proportion of
COVID-19 deaths grow slowly before 15 years old. From 15 to 54, the
proportion increase rapidly. From 54 to 84, the proportion reach the
peak. And after 84 years old, the proportion of COVID-19 deaths go
down.</p>
<p>For female, the growth of proportion of COVID-19 deaths is faster in
teenagers. And the decrease of proportion of COVID-19 deaths start
earlier than male.</p>

<p>The size of bubbles represent the COVID-19 Death Proportion for
different states. For example, New York City has the highest COVID-19
Death Proportion. It maybe depend on the high population density. So
people in New York will be easier to be infected with COVID-19. We’d
better stratify our data by states. So we can assume people in certain
states can have a same risk to be infected with COVID and have a same
vaccination status.</p>
<p>And sample size of death data also vary from states. California has
the most sample size, so California will have the much power to affect
our result.</p>

<p>From those two spaghetti plots, we find the increase rate of COVID-19
deaths proportion for male is fast from 15 years old to 54 years old.
When age beyond 55 years, the increase rate of COVID-19 deaths
proportion get slow. For female, there is no obvious break point of the
increase rate of COVID-19 deaths proportion. At about 55 years old, the
change of COVID-19 deaths proportion converted from increase to
decrease.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>There is a association between patients’ age groups and the
proportion of COVID-19 deaths. With the increase of patients’ age, the
proportion of COVID-19 deaths get higher. However, this relationship was
sex-specific. The increase rate of COVID-19 deaths proportion for male
is fast from 15 years old to 54 years old. When age beyond 55, the
increase rate of COVID-19 deaths proportion get slow. For female, there
is no obvious break point of the increase rate. Around 55 years old, the
change of COVID-19 deaths proportion converted from increase to
decrease.</strong></p>
